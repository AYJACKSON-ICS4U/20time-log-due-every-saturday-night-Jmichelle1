# 20Time-ICS4U
## Week 1
1.  My project will be to write a piece of music.
I want to have multiple instruments playing different parts, the clarinet, flute and possibly the piano.
If I have questions, I can talk to my music teacher or one of my friends.

2.  I'm finding it easier to write music when I try to represent whatever emotion I'm feeling at the time.
So far I have written a short phrase for one instrument that I can possibly use in my music, and determined a chord that goes with it.

## Week 2
I have written 11 bars for the flute and 11 bars for the clarinet that goes with it.  I also wrote another short section for the clarinet.  It's easiest to write down anything I think of then go through after to edit it (change the note, the length, decide where to put it in the song.)  I find that if I put it down and come back to it a few hours later its easier to come up with new ideas.

## Week 3
This week I haven't made much progess.  I have been working with the introduction and trying to decide if I want to change keys.  I have been figuring out what works well when the clarinet and flute are playing together.

## Week 4
This week I have continued figuring out which notes sound good when played together. I have decided I will just have the flute and clarinet, no piano.

## Week 5
This week I realised I had to change the key of the song to get the sound that I want.  I rewrote part of the beginning so that there is no longer so much going on.  I am trying to use call and response in the music.

## Week 6
This week I haven't done much work on the music. I'm deciding if I want to possibly use ABA form and possibly change the style of the middle of the piece.  I'm going to use MuseScore to write my good copy of the music.

## Week 7
1. I added the files for the electronic copies of the music I wrote. JordanSongBoth has the flute and clarinet parts, all three files need to be opened in musescore 2
2. I realized that the flute can play higher than I thought, so I was able to have the flute play some of what I had the clarinet playing originally. I had to then change the clarinet part for that bar, but I still have not quite found the right sound.

## Week 8
Listening to my song on musescore, I noticed the transitions between some phrases don't quite work, so I'm working on changing them / adding a bar in between.
