## Week 1
1.  My project will be to write a piece of music.
I want to have multiple instruments playing different parts, the clarinet, flute and possibly the piano.
If I have questions, I can talk to my music teacher or one of my friends.

2.  I'm finding it easier to write music when I try to represent whatever emotion I'm feeling at the time.
So far I have written a short phrase for one instrument that I can possibly use in my music, and determined a chord that goes with it.

## Week 2
I have written 11 bars for the flute and 11 bars for the clarinet that goes with it.  It's easiest to write down anything I think of then go through after to edit it (change the note, the length, decide where to put it in the song.)  I find that if I put it down and come back to it a few hours later its easier to come up with new ideas.
